First "Battleship" basic game project with Python made by Laura Pimentel and Daniel Carrera

This project has been realized using the NumPy Python library.

## How to play
  In this basic "Battleship" the user can play against the CPU, who will choose the squares where it wants to drop its bombs randomly.
  
 - First each player is going to be assigned a board of ships with random positions each.
Each board has 1 ship with 4 positions, 2 ships with 3 positions, 3 ships with 2 positions and 4 ships with 1 position.
- When the game starts you will have to choose a number for a row and a number for the column where you want to attack and for each success you will get another chance. The opponent will attack with random coordinates.
- The game ends when one of the two players sinks all the opponent's ships. Throughout the game there will be an option to exit by pressing "S".
  
### Meaning of what we see during the game:
1. ' - ' = water
2. ' O ' = part of a ship
3. ' X ' = part of a sinking ship
